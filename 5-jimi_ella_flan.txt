Scene 5 jimi-ella-flan


OPEN WITH NIGHTMARE INTRO

NARRATOR

She looks up through the suddenly transparent walls and ceilings of these towers to see an odd flash of light knock into the spires and send them tumbling. The shards begin to rain down all around her as she shields her eyes, noticing her son...and someone else familiar...as well as an owlish lumberjack of a man...so many more and they are all screaming, as the towers made of crystal crash down to form a great cloud of empty space coming to envelope them all. A throbbing sound pervades her skull, rhythmic in its omen, as the void comes to swallow her and everyone she loves. The throbbing sound takes over.

Jimi wakes up to the sound of an alarm like a shovel striking gravel. She tosses her arm at the off button and stares briefly, before rolling her eyes back and closing them again. A moment passes. She breathes in deeply and flips out of bed while looking back at Ella, who is asleep on the other side as she turns toward the door.

She zombie walks to the kitchen, puts on a pot of coffee, picks up the paper, walks to the widescreen computer, puts the paper down, and grabs the remote.

Jimi is greeted by the vomit-inducing voice of an anchorwoman:

VOMIT ANCHORWOMAN
The foxtail comet continues to brighten the skies tonight with what astronomers forecast to be the brightest night yet!

NARRATOR
The voice of a wretch-fetching anchorman replies:

WRETCH ANCHORMAN
That's right, Judy. In fact, there are some of the most outspoken experts in the fields of science and stuff that will be attending an exclusive viewing of the comet from our city's newest observatory.

VOMIT ANCHORWOMAN
Sounds exciting!

WRETCH ANCHORMAN
Oh, don't kid yourself, you know I'll be at the Phasers game!

VOMIT ANCHORWOMAN
Oh, Bill!

WRETCH ANCHORMAN
Oh, Judy!

JIMI
What to do...

NARRATOR
Jimi is reading the news, now, seated at a sturdy dining room table. Her son is playing a video game in the other room. He stares intently at the screen, focused. Figures on the screen start to fall apart and reassemble. Bits of the 4-dimensional lattice-work break down and reform.

JIMI
Ella! Are you awake yet?

NARRATOR
Jimi's son flinches slightly and appears to notice the world outside of the game. He smiles uneasily.

ELLA
Why would I be awake? It's 4 o'clock.

JIMI
Why wouldn't you be awake? It's 4PM. We have to leave for the party you wanted to go to.

ELLA
Why would anyone show up early to a comet viewing party? That's duuuumb.

JIMI
Sleeping in until 4 is duuuuumb.

ELLA
Ok, ok, I'm getting up. I was up late licking tree sap, kiss me.

JIMI
What were you getting tree sap for?

ELLA
Research on synthetic phloe sap. It's supposed to be good for promoting insect population growth.

JIMI
Phloe sap? Isn't that one of those, what-do-you-call-them organics?

ELLA
Spooky organics. They're easy to replicate for some reason, like they were engineered. I guess I'm not supposed to talk about it, though...Duuuuumb.

JIMI
Not supposed to talk about it?

ELLA
Well, these guys came in the other day, saying they were with the CDC, and that they were looking into the possibility that spooky organics could be some kind of virus carrier, but that's ridiculous! Besides, those guys were definitely not from the CDC. They've probably never worn lab coats in their entire lives.

JIMI
Hmm, I dunno. Nobody seems to wear lab coats these days.

FLAN
Can we stop by the Circuit-Tree before we go to that party, mom?

JIMI
Only if you've finished your homework, Flan.

NARRATOR
Flan looks back at the screen and the objects freeze. He gets up, carefully retrieves something from a table in the room and brings it over.

FLAN
I did my homework. We made model replicas of early 21st century shuttles. I did this Space-X design.

ELLA
It's very intricate.

JIMI
Huh. Looks like a beaver.

ELLA
Whatever, master zoologist. I like your spaceship.

JIMI
Highly paid master zoologist. And why is the school sending my child home with inaccurate spaceship blueprints?

ELLA
He's twelve.

JIMI
Treat him like a baby, and he's gonna be a baby.

ELLA
You're the baby...come on, let's get read to go.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

JIMI
Why are you trying to promote insect longevity?

ELLA
Hmm?

JIMI
Earlier, you were talking about sap for bugs.

ELLA
Oh, not longevity--population growth. This is about large numbers and large mass, enough to feed and provide.

FLAN
I don't wanna eat bugs.

ELLA
We eat bugs everyday, kiddo.

JIMI
Flan, we don't actually eat bugs, we just use their...secretions so we can make your favourite spaghetti and make this car move. Like Soylent Green.

ELLA
Too young to know.

JIMI
Who, you or Flan?...What is it?

ELLA
I just remembered this dream I had last night. We were all on a bridge--some sort of platform between two giant towers made of glass or something?

JIMI
Uh-huh.

ELLA
I was lying down on my stomach and you were tattooing a rhombus onto my back. There were a bunch of hairy people telling you to hurry up. The towers around us started to fall. All of us were crushed by the crumbling crystals and thrown around.

JIMI
I had the same dream.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NARRATOR
Out in space, the Foxtail Comet nears the planet Earth. Deep within the sparkling mist, activity bustles in secret. Through the mist, music thumps louder and louder. Figures dance wildly in the glistening fog as patterns swirl and spiral around their flailing limbs. At the center, the Spacefox and Sparkles laugh deliriously, or at least this is what an outside observer would appear to witness. From their point of view, the revelers of this party are playfully shaking the snow-globe that is this universe and watching all the particles float about.

Spacefox pauses mid-dance, turning her snout to the misty mists and wrinkling her black nose to take in a stray whiff.

SPACEFOX
I smell a smell which smells...smelly. It's coming from over...there!

NARRATOR
Suddenly, as if her finger were a jet of air, the mist parts, creating a tunnel into space, revealing the full earth, glowing in the void.

SPARKLES
Perhaps you should go investigate.

NARRATOR
He lifts a hand and a car-sized chunk of sparklerock separates from the ground to levitate besides them.

SPARKLES
Climb in.

NARRATOR
Spacefox closes her eyes and twitches her nose. She starts to disintegrate from her extremities, the particles floating in a curve to be absorbed by the chunk of levitating sparklerock. The sparkles flicks it's wrist and sends the piece of rock shooting out toward the planet.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NARRATOR
A mud-stained volvo pulls up to a warehouse under a bridge. Out  steps Jimi, in a suit, Ella in a dark gown with some sort of feathery shoulder extension thing on one side, and Flan in a NASA jumpsuit.

JIMI
This is the place?

ELLA
Yeah, isn't it great?

JIMI
I don't think we should be bringing Flan here.

ELLA
Oh? Who's treating him like a baby now, huh?

NARRATOR
They are interrupted by a doorman.

DOORMAN
Good evening, and welcome to Sanctuary. May I see your invitations, please?

NARRATOR
As Ella pulls paper from her purse, they listen to the muffled sounds of jazz music blended with down-tempo electronica, periodically unmuffled every time someone opens the door.

They pass into the place via the coat check and enter the interior of the warehouse, more of a well kept art studio than a place where goods were once stored. Multi-coloured lights shade the walls. They pass by works displayed on the wall, showcasing scientific advancement as expressions of art.

A man turns, with the barest glimmer of a smile of recognition at the sight of Jimi

JAMES BIGMAN
Jimi! How long has it been!

JIMI
Oh, jeez, it's James.

ELLA
The one from back...then?

JIMI
Well, well, if it isn't Brigadier Bigman! I didn't expect to see your jarhead around all these folk.

JAMES BIGMAN
Life is life, huh? You know...ever since Ricardo, I...

JIMI
I never saw someone so aware of what was going on just walk blindly into oblivion.

JAMES BIGMAN
He didn't walk. He ran. And I can assure you it wasn't blnd.

JIMI
Then he willingly left us here without him?!

JAMES BIGMAN
I'm sorry, Jimi.

ELLA
You know, you can't just live in the past like this, Jimi. Think of it like this, you two shared something beautiful, and even though that can't ever be recaptured, it also can't be ruined. It's kind of perfect, in a way. You should let that feeling be so you can think about tomorrow and what other great things might lie in the future.

JIMI
Is that how you justify the kind of shit you pull? What do you know? What the hell is tomorrow? I'm gonna smoke a cigarette.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
[WHAT IS THIS TOMORROW]


NARRATOR
Jimi bustles through the gallery while averting her face from the glances fired her way.

JIMI
Why am I still with her? After all this shit...What is love, anymore? Am I too jaded for this kind of life, now? IS there any way to reconcile the past?

NARRATOR
She pushes the door open, passing the threshold into another world, a single point of light casting shadows upon the industrial facade around her. She looks upwards to see the traffic of wispy clouds, hastened by the wind, broken periodically to allow the light of the moon and a few stars to grace the mud of the earth. As she peers into space, one of the clouds seems to shine a bit. The glow brightens, turning red. Then, suddenly, the cloud explodes and from it is propelled a fireball, trailing smoke. It seems to be headed directly toward her.

She stares, dumbfounded, cigarette propped precariously between her lips, as the fireball smashes into the street in front of her, gouging a smoldering rut in the ground as it pummels into the front of the warehouse in which the party was still raging. It comes to a stop just at the edge and the entire front of the building collapses on top of it, revealing the interrupted faces of the attendees, staring at the mess as if it were an unsuspected guest. After a moment, they all blink and turn back to each other to resume talking. This meteorite might just have been a roman candle at a rocket launch for all they seem to care. Jimi stares, more in astonishment at the other people, than at the meteorite itself. As she looks for some acknowledgment among the crowd, a wispy, sparkling cloud floats from the debris toward Jimi. It swirls and circles her until she feels so dizzy she gets disoriented, unable to distinguish it from the dust.

Then, very distinctly, she feels not alone, and realizes she has had her eyes closed. She opens them to see...nothing...

JIMI
What?

NARRATOR
Hands release themselves from her face and she whirls around, facing whoever it is.

A wet kiss and cold nose smother her face and her eyes widen in surprise. Despite the odd sensation, she can't help but be swept up on the passion of it, if only for a moment.

SPACEFOX
Tim!

NARRATOR
Jimi can now see that this person seems to be dressed up as a fox, like some kind of furry freak. The fox cocks her head, confused suddenly, and begins to sniff around Jimi

SPACEFOX
Wait...you're not Tim...you've got...

NARRATOR
She gestures curvy shapes with her hands.

SPACEFOX
And...you smell nicer.
