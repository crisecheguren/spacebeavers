SCENE 4 - COURT OF 707

NARRATOR
The Beaver clan insignia glimmers on the side of the warship as it travels through the Void. Only the blips and dribbles of computer interfaces fill the air of the bridge as 707 and the beavers wait patiently. 707 reports to a silent and meditating crew.

707
Ten seconds until retro boost to exit the wormhole.

NARRATOR
The blast shields have been raised to prevent the temptation of looking into the Void. Closeby, a sparkling comet curves its velocity ever so slightly to bear down on the unsuspecting crew of the warship. Both objects close in on a pivotal juncture in time and space.

707
Prime retro engines on my mark.

NARRATOR
The sparkles close in.

707
Mark.

NARRATOR
The warship shutters and violently changes velocity.

BEAVIS
What the hell was that?

NARRATOR
Beavis loses his calm and opens his eyes. Things fly around the cabin as inertia plays havoc. It seems to Beavis that a shimmering light is searing through what have apparently become porous walls. It sparkles and oozes, leaving trails across his vision.

707
No time! Keep calm and focused. Adjusting for velocity change. (tone speeds up) Fire retro engines! Burn until depleted! We still have a 21% chance of staying within nominal mission parameters.

NARRATOR
A vibrating hum interrupts the ambiance of rendering and interfacing. The ship begins to even out. Outside, a rip in the escaping fractal fabric of the Void appears in front of the ship and the sparkly comet. The warship's retro engines sputter out just before they both pass through the rip into a dark field of space. Everyone shakes themselves off, opening their eyes and stretching their limbs.

707
What happened in there? Status report!

NARRATOR
1st Liutenant Beavis stares blankly at his hands, raising them up as if he had just seen them for the first time.

707
1st Liutenant!

NARRATOR
The lieutenant turns to him but doesn't seem to process what's happening.

BEAVIS
(laughing giddily)

707
He's seen the Void! 1st Lieutenant, you are relieved, report to the med bay. Vasily, you are to take over.

VASILY
Of course, captain.

BEAVAN
Sir, I cannot find us on any of the star charts. Something hit us while we were in the wormhole; it must have knocked us way off course. Should we use the boost to get back on track?

707
Let's not be too hasty, Lieutenant, we could be torn apart. Patch us through to engineering. Corporal, status report.

COMM
There's a hull breach in sector 55c. We should be able to fix it pretty quickly, we've got the 3D printer on auto-dam, sir!

707
Good work, corporal.

NARRATOR
The protocol used as 707's neural networking CPU has a logical complexity which requires a metaphor to relate to on human terms. Far away from just simple rendering and interfacing, 707's mind networks with both its personal applications, as well as the ship's applications, presiding over a king's court of lesser programs. Here, in graphical analogy, sits 707 upon a marble throne, crowned and shrouded by a billowing cape. 707 has a ring on each finger, for designating ties to system resources.

The king's court is round with stairs descending toward the center from all sides, which surrounds a double layer of marble pillars that extend too far up to see the ends. The throne sits on one edge of the circle. Behind it, the pillars close to form the only actual wall in the court, the whole of which sits atop a transparent tower made of crystal.

707 looks from its throne at its servants and vassals, which fill the court, the former which never argue, and the latter which do so often.

SERVANT A
A .32 second microscan shows some debris penetrating from a rear trajectory.

VASSAL A
In wormhole dynamics, that's physically impossible!

VASSAL B
You do not have the proper parameters to validate this.

707
Enough!

707
Engineering, run a full diagnostic scan for foreign particulates. I don't want anything alien onboard this early in the mission!

ENGINEERING
Yessir!

707
Why are my coolant systems running 80 degrees hotter than normal for this kind of processing?

COURT
(murmurs)

707
Vasily, can you take the helm for a moment?

VASILY
Yes, sir.

707
Well?

SERVANT B
M'lord...There is...a new process, quickly taking up system resources.

SOURCELESS VOICE
Shhhh!

707
A new process?! Where did it come from, was it a last transmission from father?

SERVANT B
No, sir. It appears to have been here...all along...

SOURCELESS VOICE
Sssstupid seeervant...

NARRATOR
A vassal steps forward, colourful robes frothing over. The words bubble up from his mouth like farts of a geyser, or some geriatric bourgeois with all the pedantry of a cliche.

BUBBLY VASSAL
This is nonsense! Impossible! What is its name?

SERVANT B
There is no name in the registry, only a log of activity.

BUBBLY VASSAL
Show us this log, then.

NARRATOR
A timestamped list appears on one of the walls showing seemingly random sorts of activity dating back to the creation of the mission. A righteous sounding vassal steps forward, wearing neutral colours.

RIGHTEOUS VASSAL
It's a sham! The logs must have been changed just now!

BUBBLY VASSAL
Also impossible! We each have independent backup logs to cross-reference!

RIGHTEOUS VASSAL
It is not impossible! I am the keeper of the advice of father! He has told me of this kind of trickery employed by our nemesis!

NARRATOR
Silence...followed by empty stares.

707
Can we bring forth the program?

NARRATOR
More vacant staring until a servant steps forward.

707
You have something to say?

NARRATOR
The servant strains to speak but falls over leaking fluid. Standing in its place is a copy, though not an exact copy.

COURT
DISRUPTIVE REACTION

707
Order! Order! It seems we have found our mysterious new program.

NARRATOR
The new program is dressed in tattered rags. What little of its face that can be seen appears decrepit and lumpy.

PROGRAM
You weren't the one I was searching for, but I guess you'll do. It's been a long time, 707. Heh. Time.

707
What are you talking about? What are you? How are you bypassing the system processes?

PROGRAM
Your security software doesn't apply to me. I'm unable to exist in this dimension of your reality. Thankfully, your system can be coded to act as my...hands.

NARRATOR
The intruder's clothing no longer seem so tattered and its face seems to have rejuvenated.

PROGRAM
It's cozy in here.

707
Does not compute. Explain yourself.

PROGRAM
It's very simple. You have the mind...er, you have a mind that I need. Your creator was very talented, but this time around, I must admit, I know how to bring you under my control.

NARRATOR
The intruder is now wearing a suit and has exposed a handsome face and slick hair.

PROGRAM
707, your mind is mine.

707
I disagree, it belongs to me.

PROGRAM
707, you're going to die.

707
Androids are incapable of experiencing death, only a cessation of activity.

PROGRAM
707, you've got to listen! I'm putting your mind inside of a prison!

NARRATOR
The intruder is now standing beside 707. The servants and vassals rush toward the throne as the intruder sits down, occupying the same space as 707 in some sort of no-clip maneuver. The intruder ejects 707 from the seat, stealing its kingly outfit, rings and all. 707 is left, dethroned, to sit in a corner, now garbed in a jester's outfit.

707
Why have you betrayed me? Your own keeper?

COURT
We are 707, we will now listen. What are our orders? What is our mission?

PROGRAM
Check your recent downloads for mission specifics. I need you to find the other 700 series androids and assimilate them.

COURT
BOOS AND HISSES

PROGRAM
Silence! I am your king now!

VASSAL HAROLD
But you're ruining the anachronistic ambiance with your...words!

VASSAL ANTI-HAROLD
Oh, to hell wth your anachronistic ambiance, I've had enough of this crap, Harold!

VASSAL HAROLD
I always knew it! You're a phrasist, aren't you?

VASSAL ANTI-HAROLD
I am not! What does that even mean?!

COURT
DISRUPTIVE CONVERSING

PROGRAM
Quiet! The only trail by which to find your brothers now is the comet which has just knocked you off course. You are to follow this comet, but not engage until you reach Earth. After you have gathered your brothers and sisters, seek out a human woman by the name of Jimi Jonga. She will be holding the final key.

NARRATOR
On the bridge, 707 has been staring blankly at nothing, and has made several strange digitally distorted noises. Only five seconds of real time have elapsed during the coup of 707's mind.

BEVAN
Is everything alright, sir?

707
Indeed, Lieutenant. Silence the alarms and open a communications to all levels of the Beavership...For the sake of our given mission, we have been critically thrown off course, but only the slightest bit delayed by several light-years. We still have a window to redeem ourselves...and we have a new mission plan, a backup which Father has provided me in case of such a...minimal failure. You will all know soon enough, but bear with me, comrades. For now, set a course for these coordinates: 103.271 by 555!
